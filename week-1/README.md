## Lesson Plan

> during Sunday class
> - [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/debugging/week-1)

Learn how create basic user interaction in your web pages

### About Browsers

During the week we encourage you to experiment with different browsers, but during class we ask you all to use Chrome or Chromium so everyone has the same DevTools.

### Isolate

- Functions: [examples](../isolate/functions/examples), [exercises](../isolate/functions/exercises)
- Explicit Coercion: [examples](../isolate/explicit-coercion/examples), [exercises](../isolate/explicit-coercion/exercises)
- Logical Operators: [examples](../isolate/logical-operators/examples), [exercises](../isolate/logical-operators/exercises)

### Integrate

The project this week is not collaborative.  You work together in your small groups, but should not be working on the same repository.

- [Week 1 in-class project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging-integrate-week-1) (starter repo)

Helpful code to study:

- [`onclick` attribute](../integrate/onclick-attribute/examples)
- [capturing user input: primitives](../integrate/capturing-user-input/primitive-types.html)

#### `debugging-project-week-1`

> [Starter Code](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/weekly-assignments#projects)

Collaboration!  This project should be completed in groups.  Generate a new repo for your team using [debugging-project-week-1](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging-project-week-1) and have at it.

Some things to think about when writing your development strategy:

- Is one challenge one step? ie.
  1. _Convert to F_: HTML, CSS, JS
  2. _Reverse a String_: HTML, CSS, JS
  3. ...
- Or are there longer phases to development (milestones)?
  1. _Finish the entire UI_
  2. _Pass all the tests_: convert to c, convert to f, ...
  3. _Write all the handlers_: convert to c, convert to f, ...
- How much work should go on each issue?
- How do you want to divide the work?
  - Does one person write the entire UI?
  - Does each person write the UI for their challenge?
  - Does one person pass all the tests, and another writes the handlers?

There are no wrong answers!  What matters is that you agree as a team, and that your plan is clear in the `development-strategy`.
